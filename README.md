# Morgi

Morgi is a static site generator focused on supporting nested collections
of normalized data *(to an extent)*.

Content may be generated with just yaml, but for textual content and the like,
markdown and textile is supported with a yaml frontmatter.

# Bacon
Bacon is awesome

# Differences

Morgi at this time is just a structured tool to generate a static html site.
There are no asset transform tools in this tool and it is not extensible.
Maybe something for a `0.2.0.0`...
